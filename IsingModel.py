## 2d Ising model Monte-Carlo Simulation
## Author: Mohamed Elashri 
## Email: elashrmr@mail.uc.edu
##  Algorithm 
##  1- Prepare some initial configrations of N spins. 
##  2- Flip spin of a lattice site chosen randomly 
##  3- Calculate the change in energy due to that 
##  4- If this change is negative, accept such move. If change is positive, accept it with probability exp^{-dE/kT}
##  5- repeat 2-4. 
##  6- calculate Other parameters and plot them

Lattice is a periodical structure of points that align one by one. 2D lattice can be plotted as: 

* * * * * * * *   
* * * * * * * * 
* * * * * * * *
* * * * * * * *
* * * * * * * *

The points in lattice are called lattice points, neareast lattice points of point ^ are those lattice points denoted by (*) shown in the graph below:

* * *(*)* * * *
* *(*)^(*)* * *
* * *(*)* * * *
* * * * * * * *

Each lattice point is denoted by a number i in the Harmitonian.

The expression for the Energy of the total system is (online latex formula)
http://melashri.net/url/a or (H = - J \sum_{ i = 0 }^{ N-1 } \sum_{ j = 0 }^{ N-1 } (s_{i,j}s_{i,j+1}+s_{i,j}s_{i+1,j}) )

* * * * * * * * 
* * * * * * * *
* * * * * * * * <-the i-th lattice point
* * * * * * * *
* * * * * * * *

Periodical strcture means that lattice point at(1,1) is the same as that at(1,9) if the lattice is 5 by 8. more e.g.(1,1)<=>(6,1),
(2,3)<=>(2,11). A 2D lattice can be any Nx by Ny. The location (x,y) here is another denotion of lattice point that 
is fundementally same as i-th lattice point denotation above.s

I spent many nights working on this work, most of time I needed to opptimize my code, 
I even tried to move to matlab (last time I used it was like 5 years ago). 
But I learned a nice thing from my desire to optimize code speed. it is the usage of Numbaâ€™s JIT compiler. read more about that here [link](http://melashri.net/url/b).
I also instead of using multiple nested loops I dragged all these into just one.
Imagine running 50x50 lattice simulation in my older codes for hours (one took 6 hours) vs 15 minutes for the currect script. (On my Mac m1 Machine). 
also I made the code avilable on colab and can be accssed here (without much comments) [link](http://melashri.net/url/c).
