# Ising Model - Julia implementation 

I'm trying to learn Julia programming lanaguege and it seems like a strong candidate to replace python in my physics and data analysis future projects. 
This is try to write the same 2D ising model simulation that I developed in python but using juila. In the near future I plan to do a detailed comparison between the two implementations and performance.

The code here is well documentated in details so it can help anyone trying to figure out how things are going.


## How to run 

If you want to run the code you have to install [Julia](https://julialang.org/downloads/) first then in the terminal run the following: 

```
julia ising.jl
```

note: make sure that you add Julia to `$path` so that the command `julia` can be used.
